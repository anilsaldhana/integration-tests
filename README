**********************************
*  PicketLink Integration Tests  *
**********************************

WORKSPACE LAYOUT
===============
We have STS tests in the picketlink-sts-tests module
We have SAML tests in the picketlink-saml-tests module
The above modules dont run tests. But just compile the test classes.

There are numerous  picketlink-saml-* and picketlink-sts-* modules that test a various combination
of JBoss AS 5.1, JBoss AS 6.0, Apache Tomcat 6.0 etc
These modules run the surefire plugin against the test classes directory  from picketlink-*-tests modules.


TROUBLESHOOTING
==============
1. My tests are not detected in the modules. All I see are JBAS started and stopped.  No tests are run.
Solution: Try to run the picketlink-saml-tests and/or picketlink-sts-tests first.
